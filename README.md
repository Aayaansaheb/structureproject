The goal is to develop a software program that manages energy trading transactions in a smart grid environment. Energy trading transactions occur when energy producers (sellers) 
sell energy to consumers (buyers) at specified rates. These transactions need to be accurately recorded, tracked, and analyzed to optimize energy trading operations, 
manage financial records, and enable efficient trading management within the grid. The program will provide functionalities to handle energy trading transactions, each of which is represented by 
the following attributes:

1. Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.
2. Buyer ID: The unique ID of the entity buying energy.
3. Seller ID: The unique ID of the entity selling energy.
4. Amount of Energy (kWh): The amount of energy traded in kilowatt-hours.
5. Price per kWh: The price at which the energy is traded per kilowatt-hour.
6. Timestamp: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
